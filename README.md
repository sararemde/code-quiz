# Web-API-Code-Quiz
This assignment required us to create a website that was a timed quiz made out of JavaScript fundamentals. It's also supposed to keep track of the scores at the end, to help gauge the progess of our peers.

# How it went
The whole project was very challenging for me. The HTML and CSS went very smoothly, but the JavaScript was a struggle. I had learned most of this in class, but I had to review a lot of the notes and call on google for help.

# What I learned
The startButton was hard for me to figure out. I also struggled figuring out how to format the questions. I'm glad we did this assignment, it helped me review everything we've been learning in class.
